## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In order:

1. Have been working on how to neatly style elements that I want to be centered in the middle of the page (especially on desktop view) using min-height and grid.
2. Using CSS grid instead of flex for multiple viewports
3.

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.share-button-unclicked {
  width: 4rem;
  height: 4rem;
  position: absolute;
  right: 90px;
  cursor: pointer;
  /* to prevent blue highlight when clicked */
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}

.triangle {
  position: absolute;
  display: flex;
  width: 0px;
  height: 0px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 30px 30px 0 30px;
  border-color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%) transparent transparent transparent;
  transform: rotate(0deg);
  bottom: -25px;
}
```

Proud of this javascript function that toggles display when clicking the share button; also created an event listener so that when user clicks anywhere outside of the share options dialog box, it hides. Not required in the instructions for building, but thought it would be nice to have ðŸ˜Š

```js
function showShareOptions() {
  var x = document.getElementById("share-options");
  if (x.style.display === "flex") {
    x.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "flex";
  }
}

document.addEventListener("click", function clickOutside(event) {
  let shareButton = document.getElementById("share-button");
  const socialMediaOptions = document.getElementById("share-options");
  if (!shareButton.contains(event.target)) {
    socialMediaOptions.style.display = "none";
  }
});
```

### Continued development

Still need to work on javascript skills, learned a lot more about CSS tricks (the triangle styling was very new to me); finally cleared up my confusion about exactly how to use positions relative vs. absolute (always good to have a refresher!)

### Useful resources

- MDN
- stackoverflow
- css-tricks
- w3 schools
- Figma!!! Was very helpful with getting exact measurements for styling
